# Lab Reflection

In this lab, I learned how to use Git and GitHub to manage a project repository. I practiced creating files like index.html, LICENSE, and report.md, and understood how to track changes using Git commands. I also learned how to create and switch between branches, make changes in an experiment branch, and merge it back into the main branch. Working with branches helped me understand how developers safely test new features before adding them to the main project. Overall, this lab improved my understanding of version control and collaborative development.
